# Project Description

This project is a website which displays some information about me, as well as links to my GitHub profile, my LinkedIn profile, and a pdf of my resume.  It also displays some projects which I feel show off my web development abilities particularly well.

The project is comprised of 3 separate files, and the navbar at the top of the screen allows for navigation among the different files.
